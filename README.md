## What is this?
This repository contains scripts for <a href="https://autohotkey.com">AutoHotKey</a>, which is a tool for Windows that allows you to e.g. remap keys and create macros. Right now there are two scripts: one for my desktop, and one for my laptop.

## Why?
The scripts I've written serve a few different functions:
- Remap *capslock* as an extra *ctrl* key.

I've found that capslock is usually a seldom-used key, unless I'm writing SQL queries or getting angry on the internet. Plus, ctrl is so often used for shortcuts, that I've found it handy to use capslock as an additional ctrl. Since capslock is still useful in the aforementioned circumstances, the script ensures I can still activate it with shift+capslock.

- Easier access to media functions.

I probably change the volume multiple times an hour. This script makes it a little easier, by allowing quick access to play/pause, change track, and volume controls, whether my hands are on the keyboard, or keyboard + mouse. 

- Swap the *right-shift* and *up* keys on my laptop.

My laptop has an awful design where the right-shift key is tiny. The whole left side of where it *should* be is the location of the Up arrow key instead. It's a huge stretch to reach it, which makes typing slow and inaccurate. This is 'fixed' by swapping the two keys. It's not ideal, but it makes typing on it a slightly less painful experience.
